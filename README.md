# RNN Invasive Brain

Use RNN + Perceptron to combine dynamic and static features from invasive brain signals for movement decoding.

Here we'll have as static feature the UPDRS scores from Parkinson's patients, that have been shown to inversely 
correlate with grip-force movement decoding of electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP) data.
